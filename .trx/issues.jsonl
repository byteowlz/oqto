This causes all sessions (octo, govnr, etc.) to display the same memories from the default store.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nIn `backend/src/api/proxy.rs`, the `proxy_mmry_list` and related handlers call:\n```rust\nlet target_url = get_mmry_target(&state, &session)?;\nproxy_request_to_url(..., \"v1/memories\").await\n```\n\nThe request goes to `v1/memories` without a `?store=<name>` query parameter. mmry defaults to its default store when no store is specified.\n\n## Solution\n\n1.

Orphan Container Cleanup\n\n**Problem:** When the backend crashes or restarts, containers may be left running without corresponding database sessions. These 'orphan' containers hold ports and prevent new sessions from starting.\n\n**Solution:** Added startup cleanup that:\n- Detects containers with 'opencode-' prefix that have no matching database session\n- Safely removes orphan containers at server startup\n- Marks stale database sessions (whose containers no longer exist) as failed\n\n**Key methods in SessionService:**\n- `startup_cleanup()` - runs once at server start\n- `find_orphan_containers()` - identifies orphans by comparing running containers to DB\n- `cleanup_orphan_containers()` - stops and removes orphan containers\n- `cleanup_stale_sessions()` - marks DB sessions as failed if container is gone\n\n## 2. Port Allocation Race Condition\n\n**Problem:** When multiple users create sessions simultaneously:\n1. Both call `find_free_port_range()` and get the same ports\n2. Both try to create containers with those ports  \n3. One succeeds, one fails with port conflict\n\n**Solution:** Two-layer protection:\n\n### Layer 1: Database Unique Constraints (migration 20241217001)\n```sql\nCREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_sessions_active_opencode_port \nON sessions(opencode_port) \nWHERE status IN ('pending', 'starting', 'running');\n```\n\n### Layer 2: Retry Logic in Service\n- `create_session()` now wraps `try_create_session()` in a retry loop\n- On unique constraint violation, retries with different port range\n- Max 5 retries with exponential backoff\n- `is_port_conflict_error()` detects constraint violations\n\n## Files Changed\n- `backend/src/session/service.rs` - cleanup methods and retry logic\n- `backend/src/main.rs` - calls `startup_cleanup()` on server start\n- `backend/migrations/20241217001_port_allocation.sql` - unique indexes on ports","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-17T20:27:19.250225892Z","updated_at":"2025-12-17T20:27:35.478105444Z","closed_at":"2025-12-17T20:27:35.478105444Z"}

Effect runs, creates WebSocket (state: CONNECTING)\n2. Cleanup runs immediately, closes socket\n3. Effect runs again, creates new WebSocket\n4. Both sockets interfere or the cleanup timing corrupts state\n\n## What We've Tried (All Failed)\n1. `setupDoneRef` to skip second invocation - doesn't work because cleanup resets it\n2. `connectingRef` to track connection state - race condition with async\n3. Checking `socketRef.current.readyState` - socket is CONNECTING not OPEN\n4. Separating terminal init and WebSocket into different effects - still double-invokes\n5.
