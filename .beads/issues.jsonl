{"id":"workspace-1hu","title":"Orchestrator: Handle orphan containers and port conflicts","description":"The session orchestrator now handles two critical multi-user scenarios:\n\n## 1. Orphan Container Cleanup\n\n**Problem:** When the backend crashes or restarts, containers may be left running without corresponding database sessions. These 'orphan' containers hold ports and prevent new sessions from starting.\n\n**Solution:** Added startup cleanup that:\n- Detects containers with 'opencode-' prefix that have no matching database session\n- Safely removes orphan containers at server startup\n- Marks stale database sessions (whose containers no longer exist) as failed\n\n**Key methods in SessionService:**\n- `startup_cleanup()` - runs once at server start\n- `find_orphan_containers()` - identifies orphans by comparing running containers to DB\n- `cleanup_orphan_containers()` - stops and removes orphan containers\n- `cleanup_stale_sessions()` - marks DB sessions as failed if container is gone\n\n## 2. Port Allocation Race Condition\n\n**Problem:** When multiple users create sessions simultaneously:\n1. Both call `find_free_port_range()` and get the same ports\n2. Both try to create containers with those ports  \n3. One succeeds, one fails with port conflict\n\n**Solution:** Two-layer protection:\n\n### Layer 1: Database Unique Constraints (migration 20241217001)\n```sql\nCREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_sessions_active_opencode_port \nON sessions(opencode_port) \nWHERE status IN ('pending', 'starting', 'running');\n```\n\n### Layer 2: Retry Logic in Service\n- `create_session()` now wraps `try_create_session()` in a retry loop\n- On unique constraint violation, retries with different port range\n- Max 5 retries with exponential backoff\n- `is_port_conflict_error()` detects constraint violations\n\n## Files Changed\n- `backend/src/session/service.rs` - cleanup methods and retry logic\n- `backend/src/main.rs` - calls `startup_cleanup()` on server start\n- `backend/migrations/20241217001_port_allocation.sql` - unique indexes on ports","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-17T21:27:19.250225892+01:00","updated_at":"2025-12-17T21:27:35.478105444+01:00","closed_at":"2025-12-17T21:27:35.478105444+01:00"}

Effect runs, creates WebSocket (state: CONNECTING)\n2. Cleanup runs immediately, closes socket\n3. Effect runs again, creates new WebSocket\n4. Both sockets interfere or the cleanup timing corrupts state\n\n## What We've Tried (All Failed)\n1. `setupDoneRef` to skip second invocation - doesn't work because cleanup resets it\n2. `connectingRef` to track connection state - race condition with async\n3. Checking `socketRef.current.readyState` - socket is CONNECTING not OPEN\n4. Separating terminal init and WebSocket into different effects - still double-invokes\n5. Single combined effect with `cancelled` flag - cleanup still interrupts connection\n\n## Evidence WebSocket Works\n```bash\n# This works perfectly outside React:\nbun run test-ws.ts  # -\u003e Connected! Message received...\n```\n\n## Files Involved\n- frontend/components/terminal/ghostty-terminal.tsx\n- frontend/components/app-context.tsx (provides authToken)\n- backend/src/api/proxy.rs (WebSocket proxy to ttyd)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Terminal connects successfully on page load\n- [ ] Only one WebSocket connection is created\n- [ ] Works in both development (Strict Mode) and production\n- [ ] Reconnects properly when authToken changes","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-17T11:13:40.561482+01:00","updated_at":"2025-12-17T11:19:33.762786+01:00","closed_at":"2025-12-17T11:19:33.762786+01:00"}
