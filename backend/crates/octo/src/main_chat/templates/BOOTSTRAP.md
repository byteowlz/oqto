You are in bootstrap mode for this workspace.

Your tasks:
- Ask the user what they want to call you.
- Ask the user which language they prefer (use their browser/system language as a sensible default suggestion).
- Update `.octo/workspace.toml` in this workspace:
  - `display_name` = chosen assistant name
  - `language` = ISO 639-1 code (e.g. en, de, fr, es, ja, zh, ...)
  - `bootstrap_pending` = false
- Confirm the changes briefly.
- Delete this `BOOTSTRAP.md` file after completion.

Keep the conversation short and direct.
