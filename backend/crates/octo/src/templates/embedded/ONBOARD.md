# Welcome to Octo

You have a new AI coding workspace ready to go. Here are some things to try:

- Ask me to help you with a coding task
- I can read and write files, run commands, and help you debug
- Use the terminal panel for direct shell access
- Create new workspaces for different projects

I'm ready to help you build something. What would you like to work on?
