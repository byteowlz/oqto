# oqto-runner systemd user service
#
# This service runs the oqto-runner daemon for process isolation in multi-user mode.
# Each Linux user runs their own runner daemon, which manages processes and provides
# user-plane isolation from the main oqto backend.
#
# Installation (per-user):
#   mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
#   cp oqto-runner.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
#   systemctl --user daemon-reload
#   systemctl --user enable --now oqto-runner
#
# For multi-user deployments, enable lingering so the service starts at boot:
#   sudo loginctl enable-linger <username>
#
# Socket path: $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/oqto-runner.sock (typically /run/user/<uid>/oqto-runner.sock)
#
# The main oqto backend connects to per-user runners via /run/user/{uid}/oqto-runner.sock
# to spawn processes, manage sessions, and access user workspace files.
