# eaRS browser recognition

Standalone recognition for callers that own their microphone and UI. No Foxline,
Brain, desktop injection, command execution or implicit provider fallback.

```ts
import { Recognizer } from "@byteowlz/ears-browser";

const recognizer = new Recognizer();
const unsubscribe = recognizer.subscribe(event => {
  // Replace a preview by event.id; only completed events are committed text.
  console.log(event);
});
await recognizer.prepare({
  provider: "moonshine", language: "de", sampleRate: 48000,
  runtimeBaseUrl: "/speech/moonshine-0.1.5/",
});
recognizer.feed(monoFloat32Pcm);
await recognizer.finish(); // drains inference, then releases the worker
recognizer.dispose();
unsubscribe();
```

`prepare` selects English or German explicitly and starts one recognition session.
`feed` accepts finite normalized mono Float32 PCM at the declared 8–96 kHz rate.
`finish` drains once; `cancel` drops provisional text and fences late results.
Changing a provider/language requires a new preparation. Failures require an
explicit retry. Events are state, byte progress, replacement preview, completed,
optional speech boundary and error. IDs are opaque strings scoped to preparation;
never parse them as numbers. Only completed events may populate committed text.
Synthesis and conversational turn authority are outside this package.

## Local runtime deployment

The runtime is pinned to Moonshine's GitHub **v0.1.5 WASM release**, including its
archive and WASM SHA-256 digests. npm's same-version package embeds an older core
which rejects these split-frontends and lacks German catalog support. Do not
substitute it. Stage the verified ESM/WASM/worker tree on the application origin:

```js
import { stageMoonshineRuntime } from "@byteowlz/ears-browser/stage-runtime";
await stageMoonshineRuntime("public/speech/moonshine-0.1.5");
```

Asset staging downloads approximately 6.6 MB once from GitHub and verifies its
SHA-256 before extraction. The verified archive is cached under
`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/ears-browser` (or `~/.cache/ears-browser`) for offline rebuilds.
A changed release artifact fails verification rather than silently changing code.

The published runtime is threaded CPU/WASM (not WebGPU). HTTPS/localhost, Worker,
WebAssembly SIMD and **cross-origin isolation** are required. Send these headers
on the application and runtime assets:

```text
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

Do not enable isolation blindly in an application that embeds external content:
it affects cross-origin frames/resources and opener relationships. Check those
integrations or deploy a compatible single-thread Moonshine build separately;
the published package does not ship that fallback. Without isolation preparation
fails explicitly; there is no audio-upload fallback. CSP must permit the hosted
module/pthread workers, WASM compilation, the capture worklet (a Blob in Oqto),
and model downloads. The runtime modules are served intact, not rebundled.

Pinned streaming Tiny model directories: English `quantized_26_08_21`, German
`quantized_26_08_24`. The eight files total approximately 45 MB English / 32 MB
German, plus approximately 13 MB runtime WASM. German Small is deliberately not
the default. Defaults use the pinned native catalog (architecture 2, no spelling
model), so progress reports cumulative loaded bytes and manifest-declared total
bytes across all eight files, including cache hits. `modelBaseUrl` uses explicit
URLs instead: loaded bytes remain cumulative, but total is unknown (`undefined`).
The SDK forwards upstream progress without inventing or re-summing byte totals.
Models download via GET from `download.moonshine.ai`, with upstream
Cache API caching (`moonshine-models-v1`). Microphone audio stays in a local
worker. Use `modelBaseUrl` for an equivalent self-hosted model directory (absolute
URL, trailing slash). Runtime caching uses normal HTTP caching; model downloads
are optional external network traffic, not speech uploads. Warm-cache offline
operation depends on the host caching the runtime and on browser storage retention.

## Explicit remote recognition

```ts
await recognizer.prepare({
  provider: "ears", language: "en", sampleRate: 48000,
  url: "wss://example.test/recognize",
});
```

This is explicit consent to stream audio to that endpoint. The adapter requests
PCM, boundary VAD and language confirmation before accepting audio. It resamples
to mono 24 kHz little-endian float32. The local path resamples to 16 kHz. The
streaming area-average filter preserves fractional bins across chunks; it is an
ASR-oriented filter, not studio-quality reconstruction.

`Interim` replaces the preview; `Word` builds an append-only preview when no
interim is present. `Speech(active:false)` commits a flushed segment. `Final`
finishes the stream; in boundary mode its cumulative word list is indexed after
already completed words so a teardown summary does not insert them again.
`Pause` and client-side silence timers do not commit previews. Older servers
without boundaries only complete on `Final`. Unsupported language, queue overflow,
disconnection or missing final are errors, never silently dropped audio or a
local/server switch. Authentication is supplied by the caller's endpoint URL;
do not log credential-bearing URLs.

## Development

Use Bun: `bun install`, then `just check`, `just test`, `just build`.
For real CPU/WASM streaming proof, install `agent-browser` and run
`just browser-smoke /path/to/english.wav /path/to/german.wav`. The harness
paces public/consented fixtures, checks non-empty exactly-once completions,
and forbids WebSockets/non-GET fetches in the page and STT worker. Audio
fixtures, browser state and runtime binaries stay outside git.
To verify catalog compatibility without downloading models, run:

```sh
bun scripts/catalog-proof.mjs /path/to/vite/dist/node/index.js /path/to/moonshine-0.1.5 /path/to/chromium
```

This checks the pinned WASM digest, executes `sttDependencies(language, '2', false)`
in isolated Chromium through Vite, and asserts EN/DE catalog directories, URLs,
eight filenames and declared sizes. It leaves runtime assets unchanged.

The package exports TypeScript source for Bun/Vite consumers; `dist/index.js` is
an independently usable browser ESM build. Keep generated/runtime assets and
private evaluation audio outside git. Oqto vendors this small source package for
checkout-independent builds; sync it explicitly after SDK updates, never fork it.
